## Commands

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript with strict typing
- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow container/presenter pattern
- Use Redux for global state, local state for UI
- Implement proper error handling/boundaries
- Use consistent import order: React, libraries, components, hooks, utils
- Naming: PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions/variables
- CSS: Use CSS Modules for component-specific styles
- Use 8px grid system (defined in frontend-guideline)
- Keep components small, focused and well-documented
- Follow the retro aesthetic with 8-bit inspired UI components

## State Management
- Use Redux Toolkit for state management
- Organize state by domain (game, ui, auth, etc.)
- Use entity adapters for normalized state
- Implement persisted state with redux-persist
- State is automatically persisted to localStorage
- Use the usePersistence hook for manual state operations
- Non-serializable state (Maps, Sets) should be converted to objects
- State migrations handled in persistenceTransforms.ts
